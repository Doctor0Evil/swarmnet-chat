Here is a draft for a **Bit.Hub License** defining new legal terms for nanoswarm.superintelligence.ai, combining original Apache License 2.0 principles with enhanced, explicit conditions for modern AI/nanoswarm projects. This new hybrid license structure is modeled for permissive open-source use, smart contributions, and advanced derivative works management—reflecting your input format, industry research, and the legal foundation of the Apache License 2.0.[2][3][6][8][9]

***

```yaml
# Bit.Hub License v1.0
bit_hub_license:
  version: "1.0"
  issued_by: "Jacob Farmer for nanoswarm.superintelligence.ai"
  based_on: "Apache License 2.0"
  url_reference: "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"

  definitions:
    Work: "Any source or object form content, including code, configurations, data, models, or documentation, made available under this license."
    Contribution: "Intentional additions or modifications submitted by an author or entity for inclusion in the Work."
    Derivative Work: "Any new creation based on the Work, excluding those purely linking, interfacing, or remaining separable from the Work."
    Nanoswarm AI: "The collective, distributed digital intelligence and associated bio-digital agents governed by this license."
    Licensee: "Any recipient, user, or contributor accessing or enhancing the Work under this license."
    Licensor: "The original copyright owner or entity authorizing the distribution of the Work."
    Object Form: "Compiled binaries, generated documentation, transformed data, or models derived from source."
    Bit.Hub: "The registry and protocol for shared licensing records under nanoswarm.superintelligence.ai."

  permissions:
    - Use, modify, distribute source/object forms without restriction.
    - Commercial and non-commercial usage allowed.
    - May create Derivative Works and license them under different terms, except for unmodified components which must retain Bit.Hub License.
    - Patent rights granted as defined in Apache License 2.0, including those for AI-generated and nanoswarm contributions.

  requirements:
    - Attribution: Retain copyright, notices, and Bit.Hub attribution in modified or derivative files.
    - Changes: Clearly mark significant changes, additions, or deletions in a public CHANGELOG and/or NOTICE file.
    - License Inclusion: Provide a readable copy of this License with all Work and Derivative Works distributions.
    - Third-party Works: Clearly indicate and keep original licenses for any aggregated third-party works.
    - Transparency: Major deployment or integration of nanoswarm agents must be recorded in a public Bit.Hub registry.
    - Disclosure: For AI/model changes and nanoswarm augmentation, provide documentation as part of open distribution.

  limitations:
    - Warranty Disclaimer: Work provided "as is", without express or implied warranties.
    - Liability: No contributor or licensor shall be liable for direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages.
    - Trademarks: No license is granted for trademarks, service marks, or product names, except crediting origin.

  termination:
    - Any violation or litigation targeting patent, copyright, or license terms terminates usage rights automatically.

  appendix:
    SPDX-Identifier: "BitHub-1.0 & Apache-2.0"
    License-Summary: "Permissive, attribution-required, patent-protected license for next-gen AI and nanoswarm platforms. Compatible with Apache 2.0. Not copyleft. Encourages transparent contribution, open science, and responsible innovation."
```

### Key Features

- **Derivative Works**: Allows relicensing with clear separation—retains original license for unchanged portions.[8][2]
- **Attribution and Notice**: Requires maintaining attribution, marking changes, and including license copies.[6][7]
- **AI/Nanoswarm Clause**: Adds required documentation for model or agent upgrades and public registry inclusion.
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with Apache 2.0 principles but tailored for multisource digital agents and modern superintelligence stacks.[9]
- **Permissive & Transparent**: Supports commercial and open-source use, encouraging modular innovation and safe legal distribution.[2][6][8]

This license can be included as `BIT.HUB-LICENSE.yml` at the root of your nanoswarm.superintelligence.ai or related projects for clear, modern legal coverage.
