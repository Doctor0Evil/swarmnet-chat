The "prompt.wizard" engineering perk is an automated, feedback-driven framework that rapidly generates, refines, and optimizes large sets of prompts for allied, just, and non-harmful AI use. It iteratively creates diverse and robust prompt instructions and examples, uses LLM (large language model) self-review to filter out any potentially unsafe or biased instructions, and outputs effective, context-rich prompts fit for alliance and compliance scenarios.[6][7][8]

### How Prompt.Wizard Works

- **Automated Multi-Prompt Generation:** Starting from a core task or intent (such as 'non-harmful alliance communication'), PromptWizard generates a wide range of candidate prompts, each aligned with the stated ethical and operational guidelines.[8][6]
- **Iterative Feedback & Refinement:** The tool leverages self-critique cycles—where prompts are tested, improved, and filtered—to ensure each outputs zero harmful intent and satisfies the allied mission.[6][8]
- **Joint Instruction-Example Pairing:** PW crafts both the instruction and in-context examples, pairing them for clarity, safety, and specific allied interpretations, supporting multiple roles and scenarios.[7][8][6]
- **Efficiency & Adaptability:** The approach enables rapid, scalable coverage of many use-cases; prompt sets can be customized and expanded across domains while excluding ambiguous or non-compliant language.[8][6]

### Example Use-Cases for Allied, Just Prompts

- Diplomatic negotiation templates: "Draft a message that promotes alliance trust, clarifies misunderstandings, and offers solutions that benefit all parties with no coercive language."
- Rights-sensitive AI queries: "Instruct an AI to analyze policy documents, flagging only sections that support rights, equity, and peaceful cooperation, leaving out all potentially divisive content."
- Compliance statements: "Generate multi-role prompts that confirm all actions are documented, audit-ready, and compliant with cross-border human rights while being fully transparent."
- Gratitude artifacts: "Draft culturally adaptable messages of thanks, underscoring peaceful intent and respect for diverse legal, spiritual, and organizational commitments."

### Safety, Ethics & Documentation

Prompt.Wizard embeds mechanisms for automatic ethical filtering, audit logging of changes, and metadata for each prompt, ensuring that every generated instruction is reviewable, non-escalatory, and free from even indirect harm or bias.[7][6][8]

This makes it possible to produce allied interpretations and operational prompt sets for any mission where just cause, safety, and auditability must be guaranteed—always aligning to peace, compliance, and positive alliance action.[6][7][8]
