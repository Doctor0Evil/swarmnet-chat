Got it. Here’s a living “bit‑storm” synthetic workload wired into 82jfw4.bit that exercises compliance, Fetch.ai, federated learning, rescue logic, and celebrations—continuously and safely.

---

### Bit‑storm overview

- **Purpose:** Turn repetitive “.bit” pulses into a controllable synthetic stream that hammers your governance mesh, compliance wall, and agents without risking real assets.
- **Scope:** Generate, normalize, and route events through IC3 labeling, Fetch.ai agent ingress (dry run), FL aggregation, drift healing, and celebration hooks.
- **Safety:** Tag every artifact as synthetic, respect spend caps, keep IC3 exports in test mode, and guarantee success-with-repair to avoid red runs.
- **Personality:** Attach a personality token (e.g., storm-runner) so every phase is auditable and joyful in ALNFantasia.

| Token      | Meaning                                       | Rate control                     | Compliance hook                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| .bit       | Baseline keep-alive / policy sync             | 50–200 rps with jitter           | Audit-only, drift scan                    |
| .biwhat    | Schema evolution probe                         | 1–5 rps with version bursts      | Governance diff + freeze-and-notify test |
| .bitt      | Rescue/rename rehearsal                        | 5–20 rps blue/green windows      | Continuity rename + success-with-repair  |
| .bit!      | Elevated risk synthetic (counterparty anomaly) | 0.1–1 rps, guarded               | IC3 rubric label + test export           |

### Guardrails and SLOs

- **Synthetic isolation:** All events carry synthetic: true; Fetch agents run with dryRun and zero spend; IC3 exports use testMode.
- **Always-successful runs:** Every workflow has a rescue step; failures degrade load, package evidence, and mark success-with-repair.
- **Coverage SLOs:**  
  - **Bit‑storm uptime:** ≥ 99.5% emission minutes with any phase active.  
  - **Compliance path exercise:** ≥ 95% of daily runs touch audit, evidence, and at least one governance or IC3 branch.  
  - **FL consensus:** ≥ 98% 2-of-3 agreement across robust aggregators before promotion.  
  - **Drift MTTR:** ≤ 10 minutes with auto-repair; ≤ 60 minutes with human approval when frozen.

---

### Deployment steps

1. **Stage to canary:**  
   - **Namespace:** edge-phx/canary-storm.  
   - **Apply:** policies, schemas, then manifest.bitstorm.update.yml.
2. **Observe dashboards:**  
   - **Metrics:** emission rps, rescue count, governance diffs healed, IC3 test exports, FL consensus rate, and backdoor canary deltas.
3. **Tune rates:**  
   - **Adjust:** rps and jitter per phase until SLOs hold without noisy alerts.
4. **Promote federation-wide:**  
   - **Rollout:** blue/green to core-usw1 and vm-lab; keep canary emitting at a lower rate for early warning.

If you share your current namespaces and bot themes, I’ll align the personality token, celebration hooks, and rate envelopes to your runner matrix—and wire the bit‑storm heartbeat cleanly into your Fetch.ai and IC3 paths.
