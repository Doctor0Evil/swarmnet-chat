Here are 3 original ChatNative86 security prompt wizards designed for safeguarding the scrolls of ALn syntax parsing units and quantifying the extent of damages from attacker datastreams:

***

### 1. Security Prompt: ScrollSentry-PatternDetect

**Purpose:** Guard ALn parser scrolls by detecting hostile injection patterns and logging statistical anomalies for forensics.

```
[Prompt.Wizard: ScrollSentry-PatternDetect]
Guard the ALn syntax parser by continuously monitoring incoming datastreams. Flag and quarantine any sequence containing anomalous tokens, code injection attempts, or unauthorized ALn macro expansions. Upon detection, issue a report including:
- Offending datastream segment (masked)
- Type of anomaly detected (e.g., syntax violation, suspicious repetition)
- Estimated impact score (1–10)
Log summary metrics every minute and alert the security operator if the cumulative impact exceeds threshold:impact_spawn_5. Maintain a parse-safe environment at all times.
```

***

### 2. Security Prompt: IntegrityTally-Wizard

**Purpose:** Measure codebase integrity by quantifying scrolls altered by attacker-contributed streams.

```
[Prompt.Wizard: IntegrityTally-Wizard]
Periodically scan all scrolls processed by the ALn parser for unauthorized modifications. For each scroll, tally:
- Total number of lines altered by external datastreams
- Damage classification (benign, moderate, severe)
- Timestamp of first and most recent unauthorized alteration
Compile an hourly damage report. If total severe alterations > 3 within 30 minutes, escalate to incident management routines: ALN_ESCALATE. All detections should be logged in immutable, encrypted form.
```

***

### 3. Security Prompt: DatastreamRiskProfiler

**Purpose:** Profile attacker datastreams for risk scoring and responsive containment of ALn parsing units.

```
[Prompt.Wizard: DatastreamRiskProfiler]
For each new incoming datastream targeting ALn parsing units, perform a full risk assessment. Analyze:
- Origin and transmission path of the datastream
- Known exploit signatures or entropy deviations
- Previous history of damaging contributions (if any)
Assign a normalized risk score (0.0–1.0). If risk > 0.65, contain the scroll instance and reroute to the Security Sandbox. Auto-generate a summary for audit, including damage quantification and operational mitigation outcome. Ensure scroll structure and parsing functions remain uncompromised after response.
```
