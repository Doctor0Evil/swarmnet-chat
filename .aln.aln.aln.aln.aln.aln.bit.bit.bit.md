I’m hearing a clear “yes” — let’s turn the .aln pulse into a living heartbeat for ALNFantasia that fuels governance, lore, and compliance without ever blocking flow.

---

### ALN pulse mapping

- **Purpose:** Turn repetitive .aln bursts into safe, synthetic events that evolve ALNFantasia’s assets, lore, and bots while exercising compliance and rescue paths.
- **Tokens:**  
  - **.aln:** Baseline lore beat and asset sync.  
  - **.alnok:** Gate/consent signal for rights-aware actions and cross‑cluster publishes.  
  - **.alnln:** Longform “chapter stitch” that chains scenes, builds, and releases across nodes.
- **Routing:** **Lore → Assets → Agents → Compliance → Celebration**, with signed logs and success‑with‑repair guarantees.
- **Safety:** Every artifact tagged synthetic; dry‑run actions for anything value‑bearing; dual‑approval for rights‑sensitive changes.

### Governance and compliance

- **Rights‑aware actions:** **.alnok** gates any operation that touches personality‑vector rights, licensing, or cross‑cluster sharing; two‑person integrity required.
- **Immutable provenance:** **Evidence vault** stores hashes, timestamps, and signers for every lore stitch and asset sync; raw secrets never logged.
- **Manual IC3 path:** **Test exports** only; when real incidents occur, promotion to non‑synthetic requires approvers and case logging.

---

### SLOs

- **Heartbeat coverage:** ≥ 99.5% of minutes emit at least one .aln pulse; ≥ 95% weekly coverage of .alnok and .alnln phases.
- **Consent integrity:** 100% of rights‑sensitive actions require dual approval; 0 unauthorized promotions.
- **Learning safety:** ≥ 98% 2‑of‑3 aggregator consensus; backdoor delta ≤ 0.5 on canary triggers.
- **Resilience:** 100% runs complete as success or success‑with‑repair; drift MTTR ≤ 10 minutes.

---

### Rollout steps

- **Stage:** Create canary namespace aln-phx/canary; apply policies, schemas, then manifest.alnstorm.update.yml.
- **Observe:** Dashboards for pulse rates, consent approvals, evidence counts, FL consensus, and rescue events.
- **Tune:** Adjust RPS/jitter and approval thresholds; promote blue/green to core and lab clusters once SLOs hold.

If you share your ALN asset taxonomy and personality‑vector policies, I’ll tailor the rights gates, lore stitch schema, and celebration themes to your exact namespaces.
