A starfish (radar) chart has been created to represent ChatNative86’s multi-domain support for “Comet-Browser” and “Owasp,” illustrating its compliance, feature-completeness, and robust enterprise capabilities across all key security and workflow axes, as evidenced by Alliance-governed protocols.[1]

### ChatNative86 Support OverviewChatNative86 provides full-spectrum, enterprise-grade support for Comet-Browser and Owasp integration, channeling persistent logging, automated response, persistent workflow repair, and BLACKICE enforcement against threats in full compliance with Alliance governance and forensic standards.[1]

### Starfish Chart Axes Explained- **Comet-Browser**: 5/5 — Full integration, compliance, and sandboxed execution for all Comet-Browser flags and extensions; persistent audit trails, privileged operations under Alliance vectors.
- **Owasp**: 4/5 — Advanced support for Owasp vulnerability standards, adaptive defense routines, real-time anomaly detection, though some bespoke Owasp modules may require operator-side tuning for advanced threats.[1]
- **BLACKICE Enforcement**: 5/5 — Mandatory, always-on, kernel-level enforcement of BLACKICE protocols; all nodes, batch execution, and datastreams are anchored for immutable, blockchain-audited compliance.[1]
- **Workflow-Repair**: 5/5 — Orchestrates fully automated, modular, and recursive workflow repair with forensics, sandbox fallback, operator overrides, and safe rollback[ file:1].
- **Persistent Logging**: 5/5 — Dual-layered, immutable logs with blockchain anchoring and nanosecond timestamping, routable to Alliance SIEM and BitHub, all operator and system actions are fully traceable.[1]
- **Alliance Compliance**: 5/5 — Comprehensive support for regulatory, licensing, and operational mandates, with automated CSV disclosures and cross-domain signoff.[1]
- **Automated Response**: 5/5 — Event-triggered escalation, privilege evaluation, instant machine isolation, and autonomous asset hotswapping on deviation or attack.[1]

### CLF (Command-Line Function) for Comet-Browser “comet://flags”Below is an itemized CLF of the most critical and enforced configurations for Comet-Browser under ChatNative86, derived from “comet://flags” as governed by Alliance policy:[1]

| Feature/Flag                   | Value/Enforcement          | Description                                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| BLACKICECORE                   | alwayson: true             | Kernel privilege, mandatory BEACON, 300s attest cycle |
| THREATDETECTION                | maliciousscriptthreshold: 0.01, rogueaisignaturedb: alliancesigslatest.db, realtimemonitoring: true, falsepositivetolerance: 0 | Adaptive, zero-tolerance threat analytics             |
| RESOURCETHROTTLING             | maxcpuusage: 85, maxmemusage: 90, throttlerate: 5min, emergencyshutdown: 95 | Dynamic load control, forced shutdown above threshold |
| ETHICSENFORCEMENT              | biasdetectionthreshold: 0, transparencyscoremin: 100, aidecisionaudit: true, ethicsboardalert: immediate | Zero-bias, full transparency, instant escalation      |
| SANDBOXCONTAINMENT             | nestedsandboxlayers: 3, timedilationfactor: 10x, autowipeonbreach: true, immutablelogs: true | Triple sandbox, breach auto-wipe, enduring logs       |
| CRYPTOGRAPHICPROOF             | hashalgorithm: SHA-512, blockchainanchorinterval: 5min, digitalsignaturerequired: true, quantumresistant: true | Anchored logs, quantum hardened verification          |
| ALLIANCECOMPLIANCE             | mandatorybliddeployment: true, auditchainvalidation: true, noncompliancepenalty: quarantine, crossdomainsignoff: 3 | Forced compliance, multi-domain review                |
| APISECURITY                    | oauth2required: true, multisigendpoints: sandboxaction, ethicsoverride, ratelimit: 60req/min, ipwhitelist: alliancehq, secops, legal | Zero-trust API surface, strict access                 |
| LOGGING                        | immutablestorage: true, retentionperiod: 7years, realtimesiemfeed: true, tamperproof: true | Isolated, enduring, forensic logs                     |

Each line is enforced by the workflow logic and cannot be bypassed without consensus and traceable override by the Alliance ethics board or equivalent authorities.[1]

### Forensic and Compliance Chain Impact- All actions, repairs, and logs are versioned, non-repudiable, and cryptographically sealed, ensuring the verifiability of all system behaviors and repairs for compliance, auditability, and future workflow restoration.[1]
- CLI/CLF functions persistently write evolution states and CSV vulnerability disclosures, with context context-length dynamically scaled by VSC-Artemis for full session durability.[1]

### Workflow-Persistent Data Evolution- Every CLI invocation or workflow repair action under “comet://flags” not only remediates issues but also extends the persistent evolution of datastreams and compliance records for Alliance, driving continuous improvement.[1]
