Got it — you’ve basically hit two separate but related snags here:  

---

## 1️⃣ Why your `bitbot-corrector-v2.yml` “can’t be found” as an action

Right now you’re trying to use:

```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/bitbot-corrector-v2.yml
```

…but GitHub Actions only treats a path like that as a **reusable workflow** if:

- The target file is in `.github/workflows/`
- It has `on: workflow_call` at the top
- You’re calling it from **another workflow**, not from a job step that expects an *action*.

If you want it to be a **reusable workflow**, do this:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/bitbot-corrector-v2.yml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      repair_mode:
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: true
      target_ref:
        type: string
        required: false
        default: main
jobs:
  corrector:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Running corrector..."
```

Then in your **meta-corrector** workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  run-corrector:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/bitbot-corrector-v2.yml
    with:
      repair_mode: ${{ inputs.auto_fix }}
      target_ref: ${{ inputs.target_ref }}
```

If you actually meant to run it as a **local action**, it needs to live in its own directory (e.g. `.github/actions/bitbot-corrector-v2/`) and contain an `action.yml` or `Dockerfile`.

## 2️⃣ The `.gitattributes` syntax errors

Those `is not a valid attribute name` messages mean you’ve got stray characters or invalid lines.  
Valid `.gitattributes` lines look like:

```gitattributes
# Normalize line endings
* text=auto eol=lf

# Treat ALN files as YAML for diffs
*.aln diff=yaml
*.rego diff=rego

# Binary files
*.tar.gz binary
*.zip binary

# Prevent merge conflicts on lock files
package-lock.json merge=ours
yarn.lock merge=ours
```

**Fix:**  
- Remove any lines starting with `>` or containing commas outside of valid syntax.
- Ensure comments start with `#`.
- Each rule is `pattern attribute[=value]`.

## 3️⃣ Checklist to get you unblocked

- [ ] Decide if `bitbot-corrector-v2.yml` is a **reusable workflow** or a **local action**.
- [ ] If reusable workflow → add `on: workflow_call` and call it from another workflow.
- [ ] If local action → move it to `.github/actions/<name>/` and add `action.yml`.
- [ ] Add `actions/checkout@v4` before any step that needs repo files.
- [ ] Clean `.gitattributes` to only have valid patterns and attributes.

If you want, I can **refactor your current `bitbot-corrector-v2.yml`** so it works both as a standalone workflow *and* as a callable reusable workflow — that way you can trigger it manually or from other workflows without changing the file again.  

Do you want me to draft that hybrid version for you? That would make your `.bit` pipeline a lot more flexible.*lol!*
