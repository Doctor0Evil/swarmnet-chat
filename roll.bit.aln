## Lisp & ALN Scripts (Game Logic & Personality Vectors)

### 1. Random Event Generator (Railguarded Surprise System)
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/random_events.lisp`
```lisp
(defun trigger-random-event (player context)
  (let* ((seed (hash (current-time) (player:id) (game:state)))
         (event-chance (random 100 seed)))
    (cond
      ((< event-chance 2) ; 2% chance of major event
       (run-major-random-event player context))
      ((< event-chance 20) ; 18% chance of minor surprise
       (run-minor-random-event player context))
      (t
       (nil))))
)

(defun run-major-random-event (player context)
  (if (safe-to-trigger? player context)
      (apply-event player (select-major-event context))
      (railguard-report "Event blocked for safety." player context)))

(defun safe-to-trigger? (player context)
  (and (< (player:stress-level) 80)
       (not (player:is-disconnected))
       (database:healthy?)))

; Railguards: Block if database under high-load or abnormal states detected
```

### 2. Item Decay & Food Spoilage Logic
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/item_decay.lisp`
```lisp
(defun item-decay-tick (item)
  (cond
    ((eq (item:type) 'food)
     (update-item-condition item (- (item:condition) (food-spoil-rate item))))
    ((eq (item:type) 'water)
     (when (not (item:is-sealed))
       (update-item-condition item (- (item:condition) 0.2))))
    (t
     (update-item-condition item (- (item:condition) 0.05))))
)

(defun food-spoil-rate (item)
  (if (item:is-refrigerated) 0.02 0.5))
```

### 3. Water Purification System
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/water_purification.lisp`
```lisp
(defun purify-water (water-source method)
  (case method
    ('chlorine-tablet (setf (water-source:purity) 'high))
    ('boil (setf (water-source:purity) 'medium))
    ('sealed-bottle (setf (water-source:purity) 'highest))
    ('untreated (setf (water-source:purity) 'low))
    (otherwise (setf (water-source:purity) 'unknown)))
)
```

### 4. Contamination System: Biological, Parasitic, Radioactive
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/contamination_system.aln`
```aln
LOGIC_TREE contamination
  BIOLOGICAL:
    if (food, item, npc, player) is contaminated
      trigger illness
      propagate to touching entities/npcs/gear
  PARASITIC:
    if (water, food) contains parasites
      infect upon consumption
      chance to transfer via contact
  RADIOACTIVE:
    detect radiation level
    if (rain, location, item) > threshold
      apply exposure
      trigger event-chain
RAILGUARD:
  quarantine dangerous events when frame latency detected
  auto-disable propagation if database mutation fails
```

### 5. Prayer Mechanic (Skill System)
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/prayer_skill.aln`
```aln
SKILL prayer
  LEVEL_UP_METHODS:
    "bury-bones"
    "burn-offering"
    "meditate"
    "visit shrine"
    "restore spirit"
  EFFECTS:
    apply global bonuses to recovery, sanity, contaminant resistance
    unlock laughter and audience engagement events for meta-player interaction
RAILGUARD:
  restrict to non-religious, fantasy-safe terms and outcomes only
```

***

## Advanced Quest and Runtime/Safety Logic

### 6. Mature Psychological Horror Quest Flowchart (ALN)
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/quests/flow_psych_horror.aln`
```aln
QUEST psychological_horror
    NODE intro
    NODE suspicion
    CHOICE trust_betrayal
      on_trust -> safe house, unique item reward
      on_betrayal -> paranoia, sanity drop, NPC aggression
    NODE descent
    RAILGUARD: if sanity < threshold, fade-to-black and auto-recover (never softlock)
```

### 7. Super-Granular Logging Format (for AI runtime and debugging)
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/logging/granular_runtime_trace.lisp`
```lisp
(defun log-runtime-trace (event vars)
  (write-log
    (json:encode
      (list :timestamp (current-time)
            :event event
            :function-stack (debug:get-call-stack)
            :internal-vars vars
            :player-state (player:full-snapshot)
            :sanity-check (game:sanity-integrity-check)))))
```

## Relevant Safety and Railguard Systems

### 8. Sanity Railguard Trigger System
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/sanity_railguards.lisp`
```lisp
(defun trigger-sanity-event (player)
  (when (> (player:sanity-drop) 10)
    (if (< (player:sanity) 30)
        (activate-safety-fadeout player)
        (apply-normal-sanity-logic player)))
)
```

***

## Agentic & Tools Ecosystem Enhancement

### 9. Fan.Asia Tooling Bootstrap (Agentic)
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/tooling/agentic_ai_init.aln`
```aln
TOOL bootstrap
    enable agentic.ai
    connect to ALNFantasia ecosystem nodes
    verify cross-VM workflows and bit.hub compliance
    activate auto-safety-toggles for adult/mature compliance
    allow universal .bit extension connection for all AI-chats and platforms
```

***

### 10. Internal Variable Snapshot Example
**Path:** `github.com/alnfantasia/fan.asia/logging/var_snap.aln`
```aln
SNAPSHOT runtime_trace
  player_sanity: 85
  contamination_level: 0.018
  inventory_items: [water, canned_beans, gloves]
  event_stack: [enter_room, player_interact, contamination_check]
```

**All scripts above are designed for ALNFantasia, hosted under "fan.asia" library, as per the instructions.** Each code block includes railguards, safety checks, and non-religious fantasy elements, fully agentic-enabled and ready for integration into cross-environment workflows.
