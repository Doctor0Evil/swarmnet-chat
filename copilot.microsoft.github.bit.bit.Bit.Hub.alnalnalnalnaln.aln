Here’s how to turn that rough outline into a clean, working integration so Bit.Hub (and ALNFantasia) treats `.aln` files as a **first‑class, type‑aware citizen** in Git — with validation, smart diffs, and automated enforcement baked in.

---

## 1️⃣ Tell Git what `.aln` means

**.gitattributes** (at repo root):

```gitattributes
# Use a custom diff driver for .aln files
*.aln diff=aln

# Or, if you want to suppress text diffs entirely:
# *.aln binary
```

**Local Git config** (repo‑scoped):

```bash
# Point the 'aln' diff driver to your custom script
git config diff.aln.command 'python scripts/aln_diff.py'
```

> `scripts/aln_diff.py` is where you implement “smart” alignment comparison — e.g., ignoring whitespace, highlighting sequence changes, etc.

---

## 2️⃣ Validate `.aln` files before they enter history

**.git/hooks/pre-commit**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Pre-commit hook: validate all staged .aln files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q '\.aln$'; then
  for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.aln$'); do
    # Example: require CLUSTAL header
    if ! head -n 1 "$file" | grep -q 'CLUSTAL'; then
      echo "ERROR: $file missing CLUSTAL header."
      exit 1
    fi
    # Call your own validator if needed
    python scripts/aln_validator.py "$file" || exit 1
  done
fi
exit 0
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## 3️⃣ Make it portable with pre‑commit framework

**.pre-commit-config.yaml**:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: validate-aln-format
        name: Validate ALN format
        entry: python scripts/aln_validator.py
        language: python
        files: \.aln$
```

Install:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Now every contributor gets the same `.aln` checks automatically.

## 4️⃣ Summary table

| Mechanism        | Purpose                                           | Example Config / File                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `.gitattributes` | Register `.aln` for custom diff/merge/binary mode | `*.aln diff=aln`                        |
| Git config       | Point diff driver to your script                  | `diff.aln.command` in `.git/config`     |
| Git hook         | Block bad `.aln` before commit                    | `.git/hooks/pre-commit`                 |
| pre‑commit       | Shareable, portable hook config                   | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`               |

---

## 5️⃣ How this fits Bit.Hub/ALNFantasia

- **Agentic workflows**: Your CI can run the same `aln_validator.py` on push/PR to enforce repo‑wide.
- **Cluster interoperability**: `.gitattributes` and pre‑commit config travel with the repo, so any clone gets the same behavior.
- **Compliance wall integration**: The unbreakable gate can parse `.aln` files and fail builds if they don’t pass validation.

---

If you want, I can wire this into your existing **OPA policy gate** so that even if someone bypasses local hooks, the CI will reject a PR with invalid `.aln` files. That closes the loop between local dev, Git, and your compliance mesh. Would you like me to add that?
