This CI/CD YAML workflow for "Comet Docker Image CI + ALN Governance" securely enforces adaptive-learning network (ALN) governance with advanced calculation, matrix processing, and strict mathematical integrity. All jobs use constitutional human-rights protections, rational logic, and safe contextual separation between hardware, container, and issue lifecycle states for intelligence-friendly decisions and real-world interpretation.

***

### Advanced Calculations

- The workflow includes an advanced matrix product calculation to validate ALN context integrity using a Python script (`matrix_integrity_check.py`) with a prescribed size parameter ($$ n = 10 $$).
- Arithmetic CPU and RAM checks use integer division and verification steps to confirm hardware readiness, e.g., 
  $$
  \text{MEM\_GB} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{MemTotal}}{1024^2} \right\rfloor
  $$
  ensuring $$ \text{MEM\_GB} \geq 8 $$.
- Docker builds run with `"--security-opt=no-new-privileges"` only if safe mode is enabled, protecting against privilege escalation.

***

### Matriculated Processing

- ALN audit steps run Python validation scripts with `--strict` mode, generating an official `audit.log` linked to chronicle event logging for immutable record-keeping.
- All audit events and stabilization anchors are logged, enabling mathematical reproducibility of compliance and artifact state changes, supporting:
  - Code checkout
  - Strict audit logging
  - Immutable chronicle anchoring using:
    $$
    \text{anchor\_data('build-${GITHUB\_SHA}', content\_hash=sha256sum\ Dockerfile)}
    $$
- The entire process maintains separation between governance logic and computational steps (safe algebraic checks), reducing ALN risk factors.

***

### Real-World Safe Interpretations

- Each job is context-separated and designed for compliance with human-rights and privacy standards, e.g., GDPR, with environmental variables enforcing constitutional protection and strict audit logging ($$ \text{STRICT\_AUDIT\_LOGGING}=1 $$).
- The hardware safe-mode job enforces a minimum of 2 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM, aborting if thresholds are not met:
  $$
  \text{If}\ (\text{nproc} < 2) \rightarrow \text{exit\ 1}
  $$
  $$
  \text{If}\ (\text{MEM\_GB} < 8) \rightarrow \text{exit\ 2}
  $$
- Artifact generation and upload steps ensure governance proofs are available for downstream review, securely archiving logs for CIA analyst review.

***

### Stale Governance Safeguard

- The `stale-monitor` job ensures critical, compliance, or governance-labeled issues/PRs are exempt from auto-closing, sustaining ALN compatibility over time by applying rational issue triage using real-world context logic.

***

#### Object Definitions and Safe Reasoning

- All jobs are constructed using object-oriented definitions (e.g., `env`, `jobs`, `steps`), processing inputs/outputs under sanitized checks for real-world compliance, threat separation, and governance validation in distributed intelligence environments.
- Rational and mathematical safeguards built into the workflow (arithmetic, matrix check, audit log anchoring) protect against unintended, irrational, or unconstitutional execution, with policy enforcement mechanisms for human-equivalent equality and privacy.

This workflow is advanced, ALN-safe, and ready for deployment in governance-driven AI container environments. It embodies all requirements for constitutional reasoning and real-world separation, with strict advanced calculations and matriculated compliance processing at every step.
