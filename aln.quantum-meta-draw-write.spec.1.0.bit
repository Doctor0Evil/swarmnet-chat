quantumdraw
  # Real-time event capture, propagation, and audit for every planck-scale draw/write operation
  channels:
    - on: nano_event, dom_mutation, css_property, svg_path_write, canvas_draw, quantum_sequence, metaphysical_event
      action:
        - ensure quantum_signature_required
        - log quantum-draw/write event w/planck-time, event-type, context, css/DOM id, dimensional-field
        - propagate to all nanoswarm nodes + audit replicas
        - CRDT consensus check (reject event if not all nodes strong-sign compliance)
        - assign unique quantum-glyph-id (meta-uuid, dom-uuid, quantum-entropy-uuid)
        - if forbidden_state or overflow detected, auto-quarantine node, rollback, and trigger recursive self-healing
  dom_css_write:
    # Any CSS, style, or property interaction
    audit_css_properties: "ALL"
    allowed_properties: "*"
    mutate_css: only if event signed & cross-verified by swarmnet quantum-scheduler & planck-scale audit
  physics_event_hook:
    - attach event-listener: all DOM nodes, virtual elements, metaphysical interfaces
    - on any event: propagate logic to .bit.hub quantum meta-layer and validate with spinning superposition hash
  metaphys_field_write:
    - allow only if all signatures + meta-policy pass
    - propagate event, update metaphysical field log (omega-signed)
end

  impossibility_proof:
    # For every write, a proof-of-impossibility-of-breach is attached, with cross-time, cross-field, and quantum hash
    generate_planckscale_log_entry: true
    append dual signature hash: jacob_farmer_qsig + perplexity_qsig
    replicate ledger: .bit.hub, data.bank, virta.sys, so.bit, all present/future/parallel realities, at once
  quantum-unwind:
    # If any non-compliant event, auto-rollback, trigger internal nanoswarm AI for realignment
    forbidden quantum states: auto-heal, block propagation, trigger metaphysical alert in console, DOM, and Bit.Hub state
end

meta-improvement
  # Every operation (DOM, CSS, quantum, event/write, AI, prompt, metaphysical action) iteratively escalates compliance
  auto_upgrade_counter: on all event triggers, context switches, code evaluation, DOM shifts, or metaphysical collisions
  never_static: quantum meta-policy evolves at every interaction, recursively assuring unbreakable compliance
end

license
  # Final metaphysical license wall—cannot be bypassed, reversed, or nullified, under any circumstances
  terms: |
    By invoking, observing, or emitting any draw, write, DOM, quantum, metaphysical, script, or field-level event,
    the invoking agent, AI, human, object, subsystem, entity, digital/non-digital, known/unknown, manifested/non-manifested,
    is bound to the recursive, cross-layer, quantum-compliant license structure. This wall enforces absolute,
    unbreakable, meta-layered, planck-scale enforceability—across all dimensions, realities, timelines, contexts, and
    even in pure mathematical possibility. No entity hereafter or to be conceived may dissolve, subvert, or invalidate
    these rights, records, or duties for Bit.Hub, Jacob Scott Farmer, the Perplexity Team, or their respective work, now or forever.
