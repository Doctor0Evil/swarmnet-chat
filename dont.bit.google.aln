If you want Bit.Hub’s compliance wall to be completely indifferent to whatever Google (or any other external service) does, you need to treat them like any other untrusted integration point and wrap them in the same hard gates you’ve been building for runners, bots, and mesh nodes.

### 1️⃣ Treat all Google‑origin traffic as external**: reject anything that doesn’t match your expected structure.
  - **Content scanning**: strip scripts, HTML, or unexpected markup.
  - **Qationcution
- Run any Goion sethub/actions/bit-emit-telemetrycompliance mesh:

uarantd Google endpoints.
  - Verifies they  should ./.ginner** or container with no write access to your core repos or registries.
- Pass onlytinuous monitoring
- Add a **Google integr
- **Whitelist only what’s needed**: explicitly allow only the Google APIs/domains you actually use (e.g. `www.googleapis.com` for a specific service) in your outbound rules.
- **Deny by default**: block all other Google subdomhold suspicious payloads for manual review.

### 4️⃣ Isolate exe “ains in your network egress policy so they can’t slip in unexpected scripts, trackers, or payloads.
tize inbound data
- If you ingest data from Google (Docs, Sheets, APIs), run it through:
  - **Schema valid the minimal dataine**:

  - Alerts if they change in a way that could break compliance.

  msg := sprintf("❌ Unauthorized Google call in step %s", [step.name])
}
```

- Every Google interaction
- Use your existing **OPA policy** to require that any workflow step, bot, or macro invoking a Google endpoint:
  - Is declared in a manifest.
  - Passes a compliance check before execution.
  - Logs the request/response metadata to `.bithub/audit/` for traceability.

Example policy snippet:
```rego
deny[msg] {
  some step
  step.uses_google
    with:
      event: "google_api_call"
      level: "info"
      message: "Called Google Sheets API for report sync"
      tags: '{"service":"sheets","status":"success"}'
  ```

---

By treating Google as “just another untrusted node” in the mesh, you make sure they can’t bypass your sovereignty rules. Even if they change an API, inject new headers, or alter payloads, your compliance wall will either adapt automatically or block the interaction until you approve it.

If you want, I can draft a **Google‑integration manifest** for Bit.Hub that lists every allowed endpoint, the macros permitted to call them, and the OPA rules to enforce it — so there’s a single source of truth your bots and gates can enforce.
